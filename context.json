After years of waiting for the deal to be made, BP will now have to sign a $2bn compensation package of $525m (\u00a3660m).\n\nThe settlement will be followed by a $1bn settlement with the city over safety concerns. The city and the federal government will now have to agree a plan for what actions BP is supposed to take and what cost it could owe to the US. The deal also brings the amount of money the government agreed to in May to $1.28bn.\n\nAfter all, the lead in Flint water was the source of most of the nation's health problems throughout a span of 10 years.\n\nLast Friday, the city of Flint announced it is looking into allegations of lead poisoning in the water plant.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Health Department ordered a ban on drinking water in the city at a cost of $30m, which BP said is needed to comply with its Clean Water Act. Those bans apply to drinking water that contains no lead, which does not add to existing lead levels."

An appeals court recently ruled that Texas schools must provide high-stakes learning opportunities.\n\nIn the ruling on Thursday, Judge Brett Penders said Texas must change what constitutes a \"reasonable accommodation\" for a student's need for access to classes, but not what the state should define as a \"reasonable accommodation.\" The state contends that children do not have a right to be at school and can't be put in these situations because their parents lack \"reasonable accommodation.\" But Penders acknowledged that the state must be careful not to make children's use of high-stakes education \"too narrow or out of reach.\"\n\n\"It's not like they're a group that may be disadvantaged or at risk of being denied access to these high-stakes education.\" Judge Penders said."

The last time the king toured the country was in 1737, when he visited Newfoundland to see that it was colonized by the British, and Newfoundland was colonized by Edward IV between 1807 and 1828.\n\n\"There was absolutely no contact between Newfoundland and Canada at the time because what you see there is very different from what you probably already knew,\" University of Ottawa archaeologist Doug Copley said. \"It doesn't fit the whole story, that you're not dealing with much.\"\n\nThe coins suggest early British explorers might have found the oldest coins possible."

The fact that the city of Boston is home to some of the most popular American mosques (a fact that's been made abundantly clear) confirms the legitimacy of its fundamentalist ideology.\n\nThe first American mosque was founded out of an Arab immigrant family, and in that world is what led it to become such a successful religion. That's why there is a good amount of fanfare surrounding the Boston mosque, and the Boston Mosque, at least historically.\n\nBut as I've pointed out previously, it wasn't really a mosque before that the Islamic state. The second Boston mosque was just a new one built out of another Muslim neighborhood, so that's not quite the same thing.\n\nBut even though it came into existence, there were other mosques, some of which were based in other parts of China. The first major one was built around 200 years after the Prophet made war on the unbelievers to destroy them forever.\n\nBut some of the older mosques in Boston are much older than Boston's. We've talked about some details of the recent Muslim census, and you can see it here.\n\nHere's what we know for sure about Boston's Muslim history. We only know that, not the history of the Boston mosque."

    "text": "CNN's Chris Cuomo suspended over help to governor brother.\n\nMitt Romney's brother, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, came under fire this morning for making a campaign ad criticizing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for his support for immigration reform.\n\nIn the ad, adhering to Romney's promise to have President Barack Obama \"get out the citizenship\" of illegal immigrants, Jeb Bush says Obama is a \"bigot\" and his administration is \"not working.\"\n\n\"It's a bigot, and Jeb does, when he talks about wanting to deport illegal immigrants,\" Murphy said of Obama.\n\nMurphy then continued the ad, but said that because of Bush's past support for Obama, it's \"not as bad as a bunch of people saying 'Hey, maybe it's worth it.'\"\n\n\"I am not saying that we should stop talking about some bigoted person who should not even be able to get into the country legally,\" Quinn told the audience.\n\nWhen Murphy asked her if that issue played a role in the ad, Quinn said Bush did not address the issue in his statement. But she didn't address it, so it's a bit of a surprise that Romney didn't go after Murphy."

Wade in a speech at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHe called for a review of the country's criminal law, called the CompStat law, which bans lifetime incarceration of people convicted of sexual offenses.\n\nHe also expressed his desire to restore his \"common sense\" approach to the civil code, a stance he believes has failed to address an important issue, namely, whether to legalize and regulate the use of force by law enforcement.\n\n\"There's been so much misinformation about the civil code in this country that it seems completely out of date,\" said former Alabama state Senator Kay Hagan, the leader of the Texas Republican Party. The former first lady \"is trying to put all those people before the Constitution. If somebody says anything about this, my answer is, 'we have to put that back,'\" Hagan said when asked last month about future plans for the civil code."
