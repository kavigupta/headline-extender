After years of waiting for the deal to be made, BP will now have to sign a $2bn compensation package of $525m (\u00a3660m).\n\nThe settlement will be followed by a $1bn settlement with the city over safety concerns. The city and the federal government will now have to agree a plan for what actions BP is supposed to take and what cost it could owe to the US. The deal also brings the amount of money the government agreed to in May to $1.28bn.\n\nAfter all, the lead in Flint water was the source of most of the nation's health problems throughout a span of 10 years.\n\nLast Friday, the city of Flint announced it is looking into allegations of lead poisoning in the water plant.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Health Department ordered a ban on drinking water in the city at a cost of $30m, which BP said is needed to comply with its Clean Water Act. Those bans apply to drinking water that contains no lead, which does not add to existing lead levels."

An appeals court recently ruled that Texas schools must provide high-stakes learning opportunities.\n\nIn the ruling on Thursday, Judge Brett Penders said Texas must change what constitutes a \"reasonable accommodation\" for a student's need for access to classes, but not what the state should define as a \"reasonable accommodation.\" The state contends that children do not have a right to be at school and can't be put in these situations because their parents lack \"reasonable accommodation.\" But Penders acknowledged that the state must be careful not to make children's use of high-stakes education \"too narrow or out of reach.\"\n\n\"It's not like they're a group that may be disadvantaged or at risk of being denied access to these high-stakes education.\" Judge Penders said."

The last time the king toured the country was in 1737, when he visited Newfoundland to see that it was colonized by the British, and Newfoundland was colonized by Edward IV between 1807 and 1828.\n\n\"There was absolutely no contact between Newfoundland and Canada at the time because what you see there is very different from what you probably already knew,\" University of Ottawa archaeologist Doug Copley said. \"It doesn't fit the whole story, that you're not dealing with much.\"\n\nThe coins suggest early British explorers might have found the oldest coins possible."

The fact that the city of Boston is home to some of the most popular American mosques (a fact that's been made abundantly clear) confirms the legitimacy of its fundamentalist ideology.\n\nThe first American mosque was founded out of an Arab immigrant family, and in that world is what led it to become such a successful religion. That's why there is a good amount of fanfare surrounding the Boston mosque, and the Boston Mosque, at least historically.\n\nBut as I've pointed out previously, it wasn't really a mosque before that the Islamic state. The second Boston mosque was just a new one built out of another Muslim neighborhood, so that's not quite the same thing.\n\nBut even though it came into existence, there were other mosques, some of which were based in other parts of China. The first major one was built around 200 years after the Prophet made war on the unbelievers to destroy them forever.\n\nBut some of the older mosques in Boston are much older than Boston's. We've talked about some details of the recent Muslim census, and you can see it here.\n\nHere's what we know for sure about Boston's Muslim history. We only know that, not the history of the Boston mosque."

Jeb Bush for his support for immigration reform.\n\nIn the ad, adhering to Romney's promise to have President Barack Obama \"get out the citizenship\" of illegal immigrants, Jeb Bush says Obama is a \"bigot\" and his administration is \"not working.\"\n\n\"It's a bigot, and Jeb does, when he talks about wanting to deport illegal immigrants,\" Murphy said of Obama.\n\nMurphy then continued the ad, but said that because of Bush's past support for Obama, it's \"not as bad as a bunch of people saying 'Hey, maybe it's worth it.'\"\n\n\"I am not saying that we should stop talking about some bigoted person who should not even be able to get into the country legally,\" Quinn told the audience.\n\nWhen Murphy asked her if that issue played a role in the ad, Quinn said Bush did not address the issue in his statement. But she didn't address it, so it's a bit of a surprise that Romney didn't go after Murphy."

He was also critical of the Reagan administration and the legalization effort for several anti-drug campaigns in his home state of Washington and spoke regularly about the dangers of \"policies that benefit criminals more than society.\"\n\nDoe was a favorite among liberals and liberals on Capitol Hill in D.C. for his strong ties to the Reagan administration. In a 2004 speech, Doe said that \"in this nation, we see too many who don't want change and needlessly go to the trouble of making their own choices.\"\n\n\"And this is no exception in the new Cold War. If you have an opportunity to talk you're going to have a chance to do it,\" he added.\n\nHe said that if marijuana legalization were legal, there are many \"policies in place that have no place to go.\"\n\nDoe also said he would work to work to end the Drug War \u2014 and, if elected, to end the Drug Enforcement Administration."

It's the sort of cash that even Hillary Clinton would have given the former secretary of state if he had been allowed to spend it on a campaign, it has been reported.\n\n\"I just raised two million dollars so far, so we should be very proud of ourselves,\" he said. \"We should be very proud of doing the amount of great work we're doing. We shouldn't have just gotten out of the bottom without getting out of the bottom with the money.\"\n\nBut this is no new idea for the Republican presidential candidate. He said in May 2005 that he had given $3.5m to a charity which raised $14m through television advertising in 2000, followed by $3m through his own account in 2008 in New York and another $2.5m last December in Miami."

In 1968, Congress decided that doctors should be required to deliver the pills from a hospital, but did not impose the requirement when they visited emergency departments. Since then, it has been proposed in Congress and elsewhere as an alternative that should be available at all times. In other words, as in Roe v. Wade, there should be no barriers to birth control abortion.\n\nIn an effort to curb its popularity, the Federal Government is forcing that kind of regulation through the abortion regulations of other states. For example, Massachusetts is considering banning abortions after 18 weeks \u2014 the first time the state has done so since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The State's attorney general, David J. O'Connor, is under consideration by Congress.\n\nBut what makes this situation a major problem for medical organizations like the National Abortion Federation is that the regulation can't be imposed from the outside. What has to happen before it's acceptable to impose restrictions on abortion, in the eyes of the law, is that the organization gets to try to overturn what it considered to be the legal ban on abortions.\n\nBecause the regulation can't be imposed outright without a court ruling on the legality of the abortion, groups of doctors say the same thing."

The case was a \"top secret\" deal, the report said, a key part of a master's contract Epstein struck as part of a sex deal."

He argued that the individual mandate was unconstitutional under Section 5 of the Affordable Care Act. To avoid that clash, President Obama's health care proposal included a two-day extension for expanded Medicaid coverage for both male and female Americans for Life (including those in low-income households), and expanded the Medicaid program that covers people who live in poverty.\n\nOpponents of Medicaid expansion argued that the Affordable Care Act didn't cover coverage for women and would require everyone to pay about $26,000 a month."

'One can never be too careful with how you approach a case, even though you have tried to hide it from us,' the judge wrote, adding that, '[Maxwell] knew that his clients were young. He knew their age, had no idea which girls they knew, and that this was one of the reasons they were so vulnerable'.\n\nThe ruling means Epstein may appeal if it remains unpleased in his own trial.

We'd have a lovely family dinner at a restaurant and they'd have a good discussion and at the time we thought maybe it would be interesting if you could keep tabs on each other's work.\n\n\"Oh yeah, here's me. I didn't want that to happen after all... it's nice there's new stuff at hand.\"\n\nSo it sounds like they haven't found anything to support their recent speculation for the future of the book."

They usually have a different mother, a different father or a different mother's voice, or both.\n\nThese infants were born as a matter of course, with their mother and father all having distinct voices, which gave the twins special meaning. That was the case.\n\nAll four siblings have distinct lives. Each has been there and done that. And at times that particular life came up, they both had their own voices, and each of them had their own story about it.\n\nThe baby sister is in her third year of life, and this is the daughter that's grown up. It's her second year. The sister has both daughters. That's the sister of hers. For her the birth father takes the baby. The sister's own voice, that's the voice she used to call herself. She'll call herself Mommy. She'll call herself Mommy when she gets too drunk. When her mommy gets too drunk and starts getting up, her mommy starts singing. Her mommy starts singing!\n\nThe mommy will call herself Mommy Mom. The daughter's voice will be her own. She goes to school, goes out, and doesn't come back until her mommy called her her little sister."

    "text": "Canada reaches $31bn deal in indigenous child welfare case.\n\nBut with the Indian government insisting that it can \"not deny a waiver\" of the rights of the women, the legal battle to resolve has taken a toll.\n\nWith women's rights lawyers in Ottawa keenly involved, the women's lawyers have been working for months for more than 100 days in challenging the decision from the Supreme Court to grant a waiver.\n\nThe challenge raises the issue of whether the government has a legal duty to ensure that foreign agencies can't force local governments to agree to accept child welfare contracts in their own communities.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, the Supreme Court ruled that a court could order Indian government to force agencies to meet or abide by an international tribunal's interpretation of the Indian Supreme Court's ruling on child protection.\n\nBut the Supreme Court has until May to explain that's not what the government has been doing to the women and how the government can enforce the waiver.\n\nLast year a three-judge panel for the Indian Supreme Court overturned a lower court order requiring the women's law service to accept the voluntary payment made under the Indian Child Welfare Act and its waiver.\n\nThis was a critical step toward creating a framework that would prevent governments from failing to give foreign agencies, particularly in poor communities, a leg up over local governments in the process of securing the contract."

Who doesn't like 'separate but equal'.\n\nI do believe on this issue we need to look at what is not legal is what we don't understand, that it is actually not constitutional. We can call that a problem, like we need to find a solution.\n\nBut this is not to condemn anybody who thinks there may be some kind of equality. We need to look at what's possible in the world and the challenges we face at the world's largest and most innovative computer and internet and data center technology facilities.\n\nThe fact is that it's the world that needs to be more prosperous.\n\nWe need to find solutions to all this. They're not just about getting more people together. The next 20 to 30 years will likely have those things become available to a wide audience, including some who did not vote for them at the 2000 elections.\n\nWe are talking about the world of tomorrow, a great future, where technology advances every day and the quality of life continues to improve dramatically.\n\nThat's why it's essential that we remember with clear pride, what has been and continues to be a world of great innovation."
