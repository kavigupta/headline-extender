    "text": "Flint water crisis: $626m settlement reached for lead poisoning victims.\n\nA $626m settlement has been reached for the first time since Flint reached a settlement, according to an official with BP. After years of waiting for the deal to be made, BP will now have to sign a $2bn compensation package of $525m (\u00a3660m).\n\nThe settlement will be followed by a $1bn settlement with the city over safety concerns. The city and the federal government will now have to agree a plan for what actions BP is supposed to take and what cost it could owe to the US. The deal also brings the amount of money the government agreed to in May to $1.28bn.\n\nAfter all, the lead in Flint water was the source of most of the nation's health problems throughout a span of 10 years.\n\nLast Friday, the city of Flint announced it is looking into allegations of lead poisoning in the water plant.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Health Department ordered a ban on drinking water in the city at a cost of $30m, which BP said is needed to comply with its Clean Water Act. Those bans apply to drinking water that contains no lead, which does not add to existing lead levels."
